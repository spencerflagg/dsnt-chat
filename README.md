# What is DiSseNT?

DiSseNT is my attempt at ressurecting a valuable [project](https://github.com/gab-ai-inc/gab-dissenter-extension/issues/117) to enable truely trustless and free commentary on the web. DiSseNT is a web app built on [NOSTR](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr), and based on [Nostri.chat](https://github.com/pablof7z/nostr-chat-widget), that associates a set of NOSTR messages with a given URL.
